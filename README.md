# react-uport-box-advanced

Hello World,

This repo is a work in progress, but it will be an upgrade of http://truffleframework.com/boxes/react-uport

In addition to decentralized logins it will also demonstrate attestations and smart contract transaction requests.

I kept the SimpleSigner private key in the repo.

Will work with the `yarn ;  yarn start` or old-school `npm install ; npm run start`
